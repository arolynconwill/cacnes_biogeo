== DATA FILE DESCRIPTIONS: ==

assemblies_straintypes.mat -- strain type of each lineage based on lineage assemblies (generated from BLAST alignments in /cacnes_genomic_analysis/snakemakes/5_lineage_assembly_mapping snakemake pipeline)

candidate_mutation_table.mat -- candidate SNV positions (generated by /cacnes_genomic_analysis/snakemakes/4_refgenome_case snakemake pipeline)

cluster_step_variables.mat -- output from the "1_clustering" step in genomic_analysis_main.m; included so that it's possible to run the subsequent analyses without running the clustering first

coverage_matrix.mat -- read coverage of each colony over the whole C. acnes reference genome (generated by /cacnes_genomic_analysis/snakemakes/4_refgenome_case snakemake pipeline)

data_bracken_cacnes.mat -- what proportion of reads from each colony were assigned to C. acnes by bracken (generated by /cacnes_genomic_analysis/snakemakes/2_bracken); used for filtering colonies at the beginning of the clustering step (identify_clusters.m)

data_plasmid_presence.mat -- which colonies have evidence of a plasmid (generated by /cacnes_genomic_analysis/matlab/4_plasmid-presence)

fig_format_slst_colors.mat -- color scheme for figures showing strain types

functional_analysis_revised.mat -- KEGG annotations for genes in the C. acnes reference genome

lineage2_subcladeinfo.csv -- groups colonies in Lineage 1b by subclade (generated manually after inspecting the lineage's phylogeny)

mut_spec_all_lineages.mat -- observed mutation spectrum across all within-lineage SNVs (generated by mutspec_general.m)

plasmid_pos_to_mask.mat -- list of positions on the C. acnes reference genome with homology to C. acnes plasmids

read_lengths.mat -- sequencing read lengths for data for each colony

samples.csv -- sample inventory (same as in /cacnes_genomic_analysis/snakemakes)

slst_sample_seqs.txt, slst_sample_types.csv, slst_sample_types.txt -- series of files used to identify strain type based on alignments to reference genome; identify_clusters.m generates slst_sample_seqs.txt; other two files generated manually using http://medbac.dk/slst/pacnes

spec_coor.mat -- metadata on pore strip coordinates, organized by sample number

spec_mult.mat -- metadata on pore sample multiplicity (whether or not the sample contains contents from a single follicle or multiple follicles), organized by sample number
