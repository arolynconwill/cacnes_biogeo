DNA parsimony algorithm, version 3.695


One most parsimonious tree found:


  +--------------------------------------------------------T^3       
  |  
  1-T^2       
  |  
  +--T^1       


requires a total of     22.000

  between      and       length
  -------      ---       ------
     1      T^3          0.954545
     1      T^2          0.000000
     1      T^1          0.045455

From    To     Any Steps?    State at upper node
                             ( . means same as in the node below it on tree)
