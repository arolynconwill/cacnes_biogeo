# _C. acnes_ genomic analysis
Directory: `/cacnes_genomic_analysis`

This directory includes all analyses derived from _Cutibacterium acnes_ sequencing data.

The first phase of analyses (Snakemake pipilines) uses well-known computational tools (e.g. cutadapt, sickle, bowtie2, samtools, SPAdes) to process raw sequencing reads into tables of candidate SNVs along with related metrics like read coverage at each position on the genome. The second phase of analyses (Matlab analysis scripts) performs finer filtering of pre-processed data in order to produce SNV tables, evolutionary analysis, etc. This second phase ultimately produces all figures presented in the manuscript.


### Snakemake pipelines
Directory: `/cacnes_genomic_analysis/snakemakes`

Computational pipelines are implemented in [snakemake](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) and are designed for use on a [slurm](https://slurm.schedmd.com/documentation.html) cluster.

Mapping short reads to a reference genome and identifying candidate SNVs:
* `/cacnes_genomic_analysis/snakemakes/1_process_raw_data`: removes adapters and trims reads based on quality
* `/cacnes_genomic_analysis/snakemakes/2_bracken`: estimates _C. acnes_ abundance for reads from each colony
* `/cacnes_genomic_analysis/snakemakes/3_refgenome_mapping`: maps reads from each colony to a _C. acnes_ reference genome
* `/cacnes_genomic_analysis/snakemakes/4_refgenome_case`: generates data tables over preliminary variant positions

Assembling and analyzing pan-genomes for each lineage:
* `/cacnes_genomic_analysis/snakemakes/5_lineage_assembly_mapping`: assembly of pan-genomes for each lineage; mapping of reads onto assembled pan-genomes
* `/cacnes_genomic_analysis/snakemakes/6_lineage_assembly_case`: generates table of read coverage over assembled pan-genomes for each member colony
* `/cacnes_genomic_analysis/snakemakes/7_lineage_assembly_cdhit`: identifies gene clusters present across lineage pan-genomes

Analyzing plasmid architecture:
* `/cacnes_genomic_analysis/snakemakes/8_plasmid_hybridassembly`: hybrid assemblies (short read and long read data) of a subset of colonies containing plasmids
* `/cacnes_genomic_analysis/snakemakes/9_plasmid_alignments`: alignments of short reads onto plasmid scaffolds produced by the hybrid asembly


### Matlab analysis scripts
Directory: `/cacnes_genomic_analysis/matlab`

SNV-based analyses: `/cacnes_genomic_analysis/matlab/1_snv_analysis/genomic_analysis_main.m`
* Analyses include:
    * Clustering of colonies into lineages
    * Within-lineage SNV identification
    * Spatial biogeography analysis (across skin regions and within pores)
    * Evolutionary analysis (search for parallel evolution; inference of ancestral alleles; treemaking)
    * and more!  
* All data files necessary for these analyses are available for download (see [Data availability](#data-availability)).
* Snakemake dependencies: `/cacnes_genomic_analysis/snakemakes/4_refgenome_case`


Gene content analyses: 
* Within-lineage gains/losses: `/cacnes_genomic_analysis/matlab/2_within-lineage-gain-loss`
    * Snakemake dependencies: `/cacnes_genomic_analysis/snakemakes/6_lineage_assembly_case`
* Between-lineage gene cluster differences: `/cacnes_genomic_analysis/matlab/3_btwn-lineage-gene-content`
    * Snakemake dependencies: `/cacnes_genomic_analysis/snakemakes/7_lineage_assembly_cdhit`
* Plasmid presence and evolutionary analysis: `/cacnes_genomic_analysis/matlab/4_plasmid-presence`
    * Snakemake dependencies: `/cacnes_genomic_analysis/snakemakes/9_plasmid_alignments`


Note: Matlab analyses depend on data from their respective snakemake pipeline(s) as indicated above.
