%% Summary

% This function solves the diffusion equation for the provided set of
% parameters.


%% Step size for solving the diffusion quation

% Length and timescales for solving the diffusion equation (can be more
% fine than delta_x and delta_t)
dx_diffeq = 0.1;%1; % um % spatial step for diffusion equation solution
dt_diffeq = 0.001;%0.001; % days % time step diffusion equation solution

% Calculate how much these differ from delta_x and delta_t
dx_factor = ceil(delta_x/dx_diffeq);
dt_factor = max(ceil(delta_t/dt_diffeq),3); % a minimum of 3 time steps are required for pdepe in compute_diffusion
